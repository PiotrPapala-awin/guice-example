# guice-example

Just a simple example of Guice usage,
I am trying to use dependency injection with Giuce for TestNG tests.

## Concept

This repo is to present a trial of loading a bit different DI setup based on ```test.properties``` file. 
Just change ```dataProviderType``` between two values ```raw``` and ```default``` so tests will be able to run different Data providers and support your test with different behavior. 

## Running tests

It is recommended to use IDEA IntelliJ. You can run test by the right click on the file (i.e. AppTest.java). Just select to run the test.
git

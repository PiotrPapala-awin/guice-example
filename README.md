# guice-example

Just a simple example of Guice usage

## Concept

This repo is to present a trial of loading a bit different DI setup based on ```test.properties``` file. 
Just change ```dataProviderType``` between two values ```raw``` and ```default``` so tests will be able to run different Data providers and support your test with different behavior.
